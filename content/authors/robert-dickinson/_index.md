Currently working with the InterRAI project on implementation barriers and facilitators in the UK, and researching COVID misinformation as a candidate for a PhD in Psychology and Public Health.

Pursuing an independent project alongside Tom Cowin examining PragerU as a far-right institution and media producer as well as broader questions regarding how the far-right is functionally radicalising people and manipulating new media sources to do so.
