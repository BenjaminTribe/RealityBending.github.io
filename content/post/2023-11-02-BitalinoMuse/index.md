## Equipment

The setup used here is a low cost (~700€), easy-to-setup solution for comprehensive bodily recordings (ECG, PPG, RSP, EDA, ...) with a bit of EEG. For that, we need two devices.

### BITalino

- Record bodily signals (ECG, PPG, RSP, EDA, ...)
- 420€
- [Official website](https://www.pluxbiosignals.com/products/psychobit)

### Muse 2 EEG Headset

- Record PPG and 4 EEG channels (TP9, TP10, AF7, AF8) + PPG
- 269.99€
- [Official website](https://eu.choosemuse.com/products/muse-2)

## Software

The following software is needed to record the data data.

### Open Signals

- [x] Used to visualise and stream signals recorded from BItalino.

1. Download OpenSignals (r)evolution here: https://biosignalsplux.com/index.php/software
2. Open device manager to access and configure your biosignalsplux device

3. Select device intended to use.

4. Access the settings by clicking on the biosignalsplux. Configure the channels to reflect what you connect to them.

5. **Important**: Go to Open signals settings, then the integration tab and click on the **lab streaming layer**. This will allow the synchronization of BITalino with the Muse EEG.

### Python

- [x] Necessary to run the software to stream Muse signals

1. Download here:  https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. **Important**: Make sure to click on 'Add python.exe to PATH' at the bottom.

3. Best is to use VS Code as an editor for Python. Download here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download


### MuseLSL2

- [x] python package to stream, visualise, and record EEG data from the Muse 2 headset.

1. Open VS Code, click New Terminal.
2. On the Terminal, write `pip install https://github.com/DominiqueMakowski/MuseLSL2/zipball/main` and press enter.

### Lab Recorder

- [x] It logs all streams on the lab network into a single file, with time synchronization between streams.

For Windows:

> Check if Windowns has the necessary dependencies, especially Visual C++ Runtime Redistributable.



1. Visual C++ Runtime Redistributable

    1. Go to Settings > Apps> Installed apps> and search for 'visual'.

    2. If not installed, go to link https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022

    3. Find your windows CPU or processor. Go to Settings > System > About. Look for the System type, it will show your CPU architecture. In the example given, it is a x64-based processor.

    4. Go back to the link above and click on the link for the Visual C++ redistributable package that is supported by your CPU architecture.

    5. Install Visual C++.

2. Install Lab Recorder
   1. Go to link https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/App-LabRecorder/releases
    2. Scroll down to assets. Install the Lab recorder that is supported by your computer.
    3. The file will appear in the file explorer. Click on the LabReporter file and double click on LabRecorder.exe.
    4. Click 'extract all'. Go back to step 3 and follow the same procedure. The second time the LabRecorder.exe is executed the lab recorder will be installed and its ready to go.
