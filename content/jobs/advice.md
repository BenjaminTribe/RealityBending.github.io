## Choosing Options

Most psychology programs are proposing some optionality, i.e., some modules that you can pick.
While I totally understand that many of them look interesting, you often have to make a choice.
Many students pick what looks interesting, from various psychology domains (e.g., a bit of social psychology, a module from cognitive, one from clinical etc.).
They might also believe that picking a variety of options will provide them with a **multidisciplinary profile**, which might be valued later on.

While this is, in principle, true, in practice, **a "consistent" profile would be much more appealing to recruiters**. For instance, having a set of clinically-relevant options, or cognitive/neuroscience ones, will give you an edge (and sometimes, even for say a "neuroscience" opportunity, recruiters would prefer a clearly clinical profile rather than a "jack of all trades master of none" type of one). **Make your choices wisely, and make them with a plan.**

- But I *don't know* what I want to do later, so I want to keep most doors open.

Yes, that's a common and tough issue. You can still keep doors open while at the same time having a coherent profile. Plus, at the end of your bachelor, you *should* deciding what subbranch of psychology you *don't* want to do (e.g., social psychology).
